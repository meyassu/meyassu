### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Matthias Eyassu and I enjoy building software with a clear and positive societal impact. I recently graduated from [George Mason University](https://www.gmu.edu/) with a degree in computer science where I worked as a research assistant in the [Biomedical Imaging Laboratory](https://bmil.bioengineering.gmu.edu/) on applications of deep learning to histologic disease modeling and photoacoustic tomography (PAT) reconstruction under [Parag Chitnis, Ph.D](https://www.gmu.edu/profiles/pchitnis-0). In the past few years, I have also worked at various companies and organizations such as [IDEMIA](https://www.idemia.com/), [Methuselah Foundation](https://www.mfoundation.org/), and [AUS](https://www.aus.edu/) on projects ranging from device driver development for the TSA CAT-2 system to supply chain optimization and automatic ASL translation.

Given the early stage of my career, I'm eager to branch out from my past domains of work in order to learn as much as possible as quickly as possible.

Feel free to check out my website @ [meyassu.com](meyassu.com).

Cheers!
